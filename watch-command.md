## Introduction

The `watch` command allows you to automatically rebuild your project whenever changes are made to its source files.
This can be useful during development, as it eliminates the need to manually run the `build` command every time you make a change.

## Usage

To start watching your project for changes, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
phpkg watch
```

This will start a process that will watch for changes in your project's source files, and automatically rebuild the project whenever a change is detected.
