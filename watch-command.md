## Introduction

You can build your project using the `build` command. 
However, it is inconvenient to run the `build` command for every change. 
You can use the `watch` command to do it for you.

## Usage

In your terminal run this command:

```shell
saeghe --command=watch
```

That's it. Now you can start developing your application and your changes will be built while you are developing.
